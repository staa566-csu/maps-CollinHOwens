data source: 
ESPN top 100 rankings data (football, basketball) State with acryonym data, latitude and longitude data for cities.

spatial units being displayed:
States with how many top 100 players are within those states. 

what you are trying to communicate:
Communicating how many top 100 players are within each state for each sport, and also the home city they are from to see where the best players are living.

what decisions you made and why you made those to best communicate the data:
I made a decision to make a choropleth map with the ability to see the value over hover because it would be easier to see the real value than the color difference. I also made 2 other graphs with leaflet pins dropped on the cities to show the hometown of the players to give more insight on where they live and possibly if some of those top players are playing with/against eachother.
